These tools will empower our consulting and services teams to work more efficiently, consistently, and at scale — automating the most repetitive, complex, and error-prone parts of their workflows while leaving critical business decisions in human hands.  An early priority will be developing frameworks that analyze and transform Salesforce metadata, with a central challenge being how to organize large metadata sets so AI tools can reliably consume and analyze them. Success will require a clear understanding of today’s AI constraints while also anticipating near-term advances that may reduce those barriers.

Exploring approaches (including Graph RAG-style concepts) for organizing large-scale data analyses. Leverage Cursor, ChatGPT Pro, and Azure OpenAI as both development accelerators and embedded components in delivered applications. Build human-in-the-loop workflows, enabling consultants to review, approve, and validate AI outputs. Establish robust engineering foundations: logging, manifests, rollback strategies, and audit-friendly outputs. Collaborate with Fusion architects and consultants to ensure tools are usable, scalable, and aligned with real-world service delivery needs. Continuously evaluate emerging technologies and identify opportunities to expand Fusion’s AI-augmented professional services automation roadmap.   Knowledge, Skills, And Abilities   Strong cloud-native engineering experience on Microsoft Azure (required). Proficiency in at least one modern language (Java, Python, C#, TypeScript, Go). Flexibility in stack is encouraged as long as solutions run effectively on Azure. Deep understanding of AI development and integration, including: Context window limitations and data-reduction strategies. Prompt engineering and multi-step workflow design. Retrieval-augmented generation pipelines. Human-in-the-loop design for safe, reliable AI systems. Experience building schema analysis, comparison, and orchestration frameworks. Familiarity with Salesforce metadata and APIs (objects, fields, relationships) sufficient to parse and process org structures. Proficiency with Bitbucket for source control and CI/CD pipelines. Creative, curious, and ambitious: excited to learn, experiment, and apply bleeding-edge approaches.    Qualifications (Education And Experience)   Proven experience delivering enterprise-grade SaaS applications on Microsoft Azure. Demonstrated ability to build applications that integrate AI into production workflows. Practical understanding of AI model constraints and experience designing strategies such as retrieval, chunking, and approaches to enable large-scale data analysis. Prior work designing systems that handle large, complex data sets with strong reliability, auditability, and rollback support. Familiarity with Salesforce metadata and APIs, sufficient to parse and transform org structures (deep Salesforce development expertise not required). Strong communication skills and ability to collaborate with both technical peers and business stakeholders. Demonstrated ability to adopt and apply emerging technologies quickly, with a track record of experimentation, innovation, and continuous learning.   Milestones for the First Year In one month: Develop a foundational understanding of Fusion’s product ecosystem and professional services processes. Begin experimenting with strategies for scanning and normalizing Salesforce metadata. In three months: Gain a solid understanding of Fusion’s products, their architecture, and their history, particularly as reflected in long-term client orgs. Deliver early prototypes demonstrating metadata refinement and AI ingestion strategies. Be ready to begin focused development on the first major AI-enabled automation project — a suite of applications that will scan a customer’s Fusion (Salesforce) org, compare it against the current state of our product, and migrate it to the latest Fusion packages, while preserving any custom business logic not covered by native Fusion functionality.     In six months: Approach the first value realization milestone for the initial AI-enabled automation project. Deliver early production capabilities that combine deterministic analysis with AI reasoning. By 12 months: Finalize and harden the initial automation tool into a reliable, production-ready system. Deliver additional AI-enabled automation tools that measurably improve professional services efficiency. Document patterns and best practices for scaling Fusion’s AI-augmented professional services tooling  Disclaimers  This position may be performed remotely anywhere within the United States except for the states of New York, California, and Colorado.

Our product  Graphite is modern code review for fast-moving teams - we help engineers write and review smaller pull requests, stay unblocked, and ship faster.     Anyone can start using Graphite individually without needing their coworkers to change tools - we seamlessly sync code changes and reviews. We started Graphite because we missed internal code review tools like Phabricator (at Facebook) and Critique (Google) that help engineers create, approve, and ship small, incremental changes, and long-term we’re passionate about creating products & workflows that help fast-moving eng teams achieve more.  Our company  We’re a small-but-mighty team of 40+ based in Manhattan in the heart of Soho, with a passionate and rapidly growing group of users at top engineering orgs like Datadog, Vercel, Ramp, and Snowflake.

Other investors include folks like Tom Preston-Werner (founder of GitHub), Sam Lambert (Planetscale CEO & ex-GitHub CTO), Sebastian Markbåge (creator of React), and many more.     Our culture centers on putting people first, applying science and craft, practicing disciplined ambition, and giving ownership - both literally (with equity) and in the responsibility and scope you’ll have as a part of our early team.

About the Role  Graphite is growing rapidly, and we're looking for a senior software engineer to help us define the company’s technical direction. This person will work up and down our stack and propose and lead new projects.     Rethinking the way fast-moving eng teams write and review code every day is no small feat, and we believe that the best solutions are built when most talented, ambitious, and dedicated people from diverse backgrounds come together.     What you’ll do  Work with us to build a real-time, collaborative code review platform with social features Help us to define the technical direction of the company Mentor other engineers and architect frameworks to help us build a codebase that scales Architect new features around code understanding, CI/CD pipelines, and more.  What we’re looking for  Industry experience building high-quality software products An ability to identify problems, build alignment, and implement solutions autonomously Comfortable working with and designing abstractions and frameworks which increase developer velocity  Life at Graphite  Competitive comp: ($200-230k base + substantial equity). We're backed by some of the best investors and excited to offer competitive compensation packages. Role trajectory. We're excited to build a team whose responsibilities and comp to grow as we do.

You'll build Found OS, our next-generation SaaS platform that's revolutionising care home management. You'll be working on the system that helps care providers manage enquiries, track occupancy, handle billing, and deliver better care to residents across the UK.  This is a hands-on role where you'll drive technical excellence while shipping fast. You'll work across our full stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, Kubernetes), and experiment extensively with AI. We're looking for someone who embodies ""outcomes over output"" - someone who cares deeply about solving real problems for care providers, not just writing code.  💻 What does this role involve?   Building high-impact features for FoundOS, with your cross functional team Writing clean, well-tested code that ships daily - we optimise for sustainable throughput and move fast.  Collaborating with Product and Design to drive feature decisions based on care provider needs and business outcomes.  Experimenting with AI tools and integrations to enhance both care provider workflows and internal productivity.  Contributing to our platform evolution and improving developer experience.  Contributing to our engineering culture of continuous improvement.    💪 What problems will you be solving?   Revolutionising care management with AI - You'll integrate AI to automate mundane tasks, provide intelligent transcriptions and offer predictive analysis, freeing up care providers to focus on what matters most - resident care.  Building the operational backbone of care homes - you'll develop the core FoundOS platform, building robust modules for enquiry tracking, resident occupancy, and billing. This work creates the essential tools care homes depend on daily to run their business efficiently and deliver excellent care.  Connecting the fragmented care ecosystem - You'll create seamless integrations with crucial accounting software (QuickBooks, Sage) and care planning systems.

You're product-minded. You think about user outcomes, not just technical solutions. You can translate business requirements into elegant technical solutions.  You write code that others love to work with - clean, tested, and maintainable. You believe in continuous improvement and leave code cleaner than you found it.  You're obsessed with AI and actively experiment with LLMs, coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, …), and AI-driven productivity improvements. You understand both the potential and limitations of current AI tools.  You thrive with autonomy but love collaborating. You can drive projects independently while contributing meaningfully to team discussions and code reviews.  You ship fast and iterate. You prefer ""good enough today"" over ""perfect next week"" and optimise for learning speed over prediction accuracy.  You're genuinely curious about eldercare and motivated by our mission to transform how families find and access care.  You're eager to learn and stay current with technology trends, especially in AI and web development.    Sound like you but not quite 100%?

You prefer working in isolation rather than as part of a collaborative, fast-paced team.  You're uncomfortable with ambiguity or prefer detailed specifications over problem-solving from first principles.  You haven't embraced AI tools in your development workflow or aren't curious about AI's potential.  You prioritize perfect architecture over shipping working software to users.

MPI Narada designs and builds energy-storage systems that protect mission-critical loads—UPS ride-through, high-rate LFP systems, and containerized BESS that keep compute online. As our Sr. Product Application Engineer (PAE), you turn complex customer requirements into reliable, bankable solutions. You’ll be the technical backbone for sales, the voice of the customer to engineering, and the adult in the room during commissioning windows.     Employee Promise: Work that matters, growth that endures, and a team that has your back.  Values: Integrity & Safety • Innovation • Collaboration & Respect • Customer & Community Focus • Accountability & Growth     What you’ll do   • Own the solution design. Translate RFPs/one-lines into right-sized LFP/VRLA UPS solutions (5–30-minute high-rate), cabinets/racks, and controls integration (BMS/EMS/SCADA).   • Be the technical point of contact. Lead technical discovery, present design options and trade-offs, answer RFIs, and guide customers/OEMs/ECs through constraints and risks.   • Model performance & TCO. Produce runtime models, load steps, efficiency curves, thermal assumptions, lifecycle/warranty scenarios, and NPV/TCO comps vs. alternatives.   • Write it down, make it real. Generate SLDs, layout markups, I/O lists, network diagrams, and application notes; contribute to SOWs, MOPs, and commissioning plans.   • De-risk integrations. Align with UPS OEMs, switchgear vendors, and DC operators on controls (Modbus, SNMP, BACnet, CAN), alarm maps, and network security expectations.   • Support field success. Assist with FAT/SAT, site readiness, and troubleshooting; close the loop with corrective actions and product updates.   • Champion standards & safety. Ensure designs align with UL 9540/9540A, NFPA 855, NEC (e.g., 480/706), IEEE guides (e.g., 1188/1635), and ASHRAE TC 9.9 considerations.   • Feed the roadmap. Convert customer feedback and failure modes into requirements for NPI, firmware, and accessories—partnering tightly with Product/Engineering.   • Enable revenue. Build proposal templates, sizing tools, and calculators that shorten cycle times and improve win rate and margins.     What you’ve done (must-haves)   • 7+ years in applications/solutions or sales engineering for mission-critical power (data centers, UPS, BESS, or critical MEP).   • Direct experience reading and marking up one-lines, UPS integration, battery runtime sizing (high-rate discharge), and thermal/space constraints.   • Strong working knowledge of LFP (and/or advanced VRLA) behavior, BMS fundamentals, and safety/standards named above.   • Proven customer-facing chops—able to lead technical calls, whiteboard trade-offs, and write clear, defensible design narratives.   • Fluency with Excel (solver/pivots), and competency with AutoCAD/Bluebeam; familiarity with ETAP/SKM or similar is a plus.   • Comfortable on live sites and during outage windows; crisp MOP discipline and issue escalation.     Nice-to-haves   • Experience with containerized BESS, liquid-cooling, or DCIM/SCADA integrations.   • Scripting for sizing/quote tools (Python/VBA) and data-driven diagnostics.   • Familiarity with arc-flash/short-circuit coordination processes (with the understanding you’ll partner with PE/EPC for stamped calcs).   • UPS OEM ecosystem knowledge and existing relationships in colo/hyperscale.     What success looks like (first 6–12 months)   • <10 business days average cycle time from discovery to firm technical package.   • >30% spec-to-order conversion on qualified DC opportunities with protected margins.   • Zero safety incidents on supported sites; clean FAT/SAT handoffs with audited docs.   • At least two NPI inputs adopted (firmware, accessory, or doc set) that reduce install risk or improve MTBF/availability.     How we work  We’re builders and operators who value clarity, preparation, and clean handoffs. You’ll partner with Sales, Product, and Field Ops—and you’ll be trusted to lead when the stakes are high.     Interview readiness (we’ll ask)   • Walk us through a UPS runtime sizing you did (assumptions, curves, safety factors).   • A time you de-risked a commissioning window (what you changed and why).   • Your standards checklist for a data-center battery application.   • An example of a tool or template you built that improved win rate or cycle time.     How to Apply  Apply via Indded, LinkedIn or Email your resume to aburton@mpinarada.com with subject “Sr. Product Application Engineer — Data Centers – MPI Narada.” Referrals welcome.   "

With all the tools needed to build a site like Facebook or Airbnb, anyone from first-time entrepreneurs to enterprise-level companies can take an idea from concept to fully functional, scalable reality faster and cheaper than you could with just code.

In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.

A day might span discussing data models and workflows with customer executives , wrangling massive-scale data, hacking an integration or full-stack feature, and bringing insights back to the rest of the team.  You will be on the forefront of extending Rilla’s existing footprint and strategy into new markets and problem spaces.  Do you aspire to be a founder or a leader in applying AI to the physical world? We believe Rilla is the best place — with the best peers — to learn how.

Someone who is relentless in their curiosity. A customer obsessive. Someone who deeply care about delighting customers and solving real pains, not vanity metrics. A winning attitude. You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback. Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions. Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.   What We Require   Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages. Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools. Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality. Ability and interest to travel up to 50%, as needed to client sites.

You'll drive the implementation of features for Found OS, our next-generation SaaS platform that's revolutionising care home management. You'll be working on the system that helps care providers manage enquiries, track occupancy, handle billing, and deliver better care to residents across the UK.  This is a hands-on role where you'll contribute to technical excellence while shipping fast. You'll work across our full stack (TypeScript, Node.js, React, Kubernetes), and experiment extensively with AI. We're looking for someone who embodies ""outcomes over output"" - someone who cares deeply about solving real problems for care providers, not just writing code.  💻 What does this role involve?   Building high-impact features for FoundOS, collaborating closely with your cross functional team Writing clean, well-tested code that ships daily - we optimise for sustainable throughput and move fast.  Collaborating with Product and Design to contribute to feature decisions based on care provider needs and business outcomes.  Experimenting with AI tools and integrations to enhance both care provider workflows and internal productivity.  Contributing to our platform evolution and improving developer experience.  Contributing to our engineering culture of continuous improvement.    💪 What problems will you be solving?   Revolutionising care management with AI - You'll integrate AI to automate mundane tasks, provide intelligent transcriptions and offer predictive analysis, freeing up care providers to focus on what matters most - resident care.  Building the operational backbone of care homes - you'll develop the core FoundOS platform, building robust modules for enquiry tracking, resident occupancy, and billing. This work creates the essential tools care homes depend on daily to run their business efficiently and deliver excellent care.  Connecting the fragmented care ecosystem - You'll create seamless integrations with crucial accounting software (QuickBooks, Sage) and care planning systems. Your work will also feed FoundOS data into our marketplace, providing unique insights that help families find the right care for their loved ones.  Informing strategic decisions with data - You'll build comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboards that give care home operators the insights they need to optimise their operations and improve resident outcomes.    👀 We think you’ll be a great fit if…   You have 1-4 years of hands-on software engineering experience with strong TypeScript skills and full-stack development across modern web technologies.  You're product-minded. You think about user outcomes, not just technical solutions. You can translate business requirements into elegant technical solutions.  You write code that others love to work with - clean, tested, and maintainable. You believe in continuous improvement and leave code cleaner than you found it.  You're obsessed with AI and actively experiment with LLMs, coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, …), and AI-driven productivity improvements. You understand both the potential and limitations of current AI tools.  You thrive with autonomy but love collaborating. You are a self-starter who can see tasks to completion while contributing meaningfully to team discussions and code reviews.  You ship fast and iterate. You prefer ""good enough today"" over ""perfect next week"" and optimise for learning speed over prediction accuracy.  You're genuinely curious about eldercare and motivated by our mission to transform how families find and access care.  You're eager to learn and stay current with technology trends, especially in AI and web development.    Sound like you but not quite 100%?

You prefer working in isolation rather than as part of a collaborative, fast-paced team.  You're uncomfortable with ambiguity or prefer detailed specifications over problem-solving from first principles.  You haven't embraced AI tools in your development workflow or aren't curious about AI's potential.  You prioritize perfect architecture over shipping working software to users.  You're looking for a role where you can specialise in a specific area (ex: pure backend or pure frontend)   🔢 Lottie’s Interview Process   Screening interview led by Lottie’s Talent Acquisition Lead First round interview led by Hiring Manager Technical assessment interview with the Hiring Manager and one member of Lottie’s Senior Management Team Behavioural interview with Hiring Manager Final interview with Will Donnelly (Lottie’s Co-Founder & CEO)   🤩 Candidate Experience: All candidates will be informed of their application status.
