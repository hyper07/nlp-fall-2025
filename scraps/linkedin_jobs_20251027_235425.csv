Full-Stack Software Engineer (2+ years experience: Canada),Wanderlog,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wanderlog/life,,1 hour ago,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4332396189/?eBP=NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CHARGING&refId=d73UfW809JgB01rG8ycavA%3D%3D&trackingId=T3tFTVOiLzqYl8x%2Fc%2FSkVA%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs,,5870,"About the job  Warning: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.  Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.  Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.  We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.  We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.  What You’ll Do  As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:   Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.) Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it! Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web. Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested. Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows. Review code written by other engineers. Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.   This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.  What You Might Work On   New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier. AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention. Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones. A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels. Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them. A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.   You May Be a Good Fit If You   Have at least 2 years of experience doing full-stack, product development work. We have a wide salary range, as we do want to properly accept a range of candidate experiences. Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native. Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them. Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too. Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats. Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.   What’s it like to work here?  We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.  Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.  We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.  Our hiring process  We’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.  Founders  Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.  Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.  Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!"

Which means they are expected to accept the unacceptable.  Zocdoc’s mission is to give power to the patient. To do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states, across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans. By giving patients the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time, this will drive quality up and prices down.

Founded in July 2023 by executives from HubSpot, Google and Stripe, Maven builds conversational AI agents capable of delivering accurate, autonomous support that delights customers at scale.  Our platform unifies fragmented systems, integrates knowledge and personalization sources, and enables intelligent actions - all without costly system changes. We’re laying the foundation for a future where our technology handles complex tasks, allowing people to focus on what they do best: creative problem-solving, relationship building, and delivering exceptional customer experiences.  We’ve started by reimagining the enterprise customer experience with a support use case. We believe that today’s support experience is broken: slow and painful for customers, and expensive and human capital intensive for companies.  We are building Maven to deliver better, cheaper support, for both end users and agents. With recent advancements in Generative AI, it is now possible to deliver delightful customer experiences at a fraction of today’s cost.  Team  The AI Developer Experience (DX) team owns the tools and services that empowers anyone - technical and non-technical - to build integrations and extensions on the Maven AGI platform. We marry state-of-the-art language models and zero-ops deployment technologies with intuitive product surfaces, enabling rapid “Vibe coding” experiences on our platform. At Maven, everyone can be a “developer”. We’re the team that makes it real.  Position Overview  As a Software Engineer on the AI DX team, you will own end-to-end product features - from pixel-perfect UI to scalable backend APIs - that make building on Maven simple, fast, and even fun. You’ll collaborate with design, product and customer engineering to ship delightful experiences that hide the LLM complexity behind an intuitive product user experience.  What You’ll Do   Design and build full-stack features that let users create, test, and deploy integrations with minimum operational complexity. Implement AI-powered code generation workflows using state-of-the-art large language models and protocols. Shape developer user experience through developer surfaces that enable AI-assisted integration development for all. Own services on modern serverless runtimes on platforms like Vercel, AWS Lambda, and Cloudflare Workers. Drive quality and reliability for integrations via automated test frameworks, CI/CD, and observability features. Collaborate cross-functionally with Core Platform, Product and Customer Engineering teams to keep developer surfaces aligned with product strategy.   Requirements  Who You Are:   Full-stack experience with JavaScript/TypeScript and frontend frameworks such as React or Next.js; comfortable diving into both UI and backend. Familiarity with cloud technologies like Vercel, AWS, etc. Exposure (or keen interest) to LLM-based systems - prompt engineering, embedding, function calling - or a strong desire to learn fast. Passion for product-driven development and an instinct for delivering intuitive user experiences. Demonstrated ownership and autonomy, you thrive in ambiguous, 0-to-1 problem spaces and bias towards action. Bonus: contributions towards OSS, or prior projects (work or personal) in the AI space.   Benefits  What We Offer:   High Impact in cutting-edge field: Be at the vanguard of AI innovation. Compensation Package: Competitive salary, comprehensive benefits, and meaningful equity stakes. Inclusive Culture: A diverse and welcoming work environment where everyone’s voice is heard.   What unites us is our Values and the passion we share to live by them:   We are customer champions. We are bold in action. We are data-driven and insight guided. We are stronger together.

Our mission is to enable 10x sales teams by bringing the latest technologies to a long-underserved industry: B2B sales for consumer brands.  Over 400 modern brands like Tipsy Elves, P.F. Candle Co., and David Protein use Overjoy to run wholesale. Our customers use Overjoy to find new prospects, run email marketing, send samples, manage accounts, drive reorders, and scale revenue — all without the bloat of legacy platforms.  We're backed by Floodgate, Bessemer, OSV, and the founders of Thumbtack, Alloy, and Unsupervised — and 6 of our own customers invested after using the product.     The Role  We’re hiring a frontend-focused software engineer — someone who wants to build and own the foundations of our user-facing platform at scale. You’ll join a small, fast-moving team, work closely with the founders, and ship real product from day one. This is a high-impact, zero-to-one role: you’ll be a core member of our in-person product & engineering team.  We’ve doubled revenue in the past 3 months and are on track to grow faster — and with that growth comes a need to scale our frontend, design intuitive workflows, and invent new product experiences powered by AI.     What you’ll work on  Design and implement core frontend architecture using React/Next.js and TypeScript Build intuitive, scalable UI components and design systems for CRM, Inbox, Campaigns, and Automations Collaborate with design to deliver beautiful, user-friendly experiences that make complex workflows simple Integrate with APIs and backend systems (FastAPI, Postgres) to bring AI-powered features to life Design and build the user experience of customer-facing AI Agents Optimize frontend performance, accessibility, and responsiveness across devices Debug issues across the stack, support our customer team, and shape product direction alongside design and backend  You might be a fit if you  Have 2+ years of software engineering experience Can own frontend projects end-to-end — from design collaboration to production launch Are fluent in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend frameworks Have worked with REST APIs and understand how to connect complex data models to the frontend Write clean, reusable, well-tested code and know when to move fast vs. when to refine Are excited by early-stage environments where you wear multiple hats and drive your own roadmap  Extra points for:  Experience with design systems (Material UI, Tailwind, or custom) Strong product/UI design instincts or close collaboration with designers Experience building frontend integrations with platforms like Shopify, Gmail, or QuickBooks Familiarity with AI/LLM-powered frontend experiences Prior startup or founder experience     Why Overjoy?  Build for a real problem in a wildly underserved market   Brand founders with multiple exits tell us, “I wish I had Overjoy when I launched my first brand.” We’re bringing modern software to a part of commerce that’s been overlooked for too long.  AI that actually gets used   This isn’t hype. Our customers use AI daily — to find leads, write emails, qualify prospects, and drive sales — often without even realizing it’s AI.  You're joining the ground floor   You’ll shape our architecture, product, and engineering culture from day one and define what Overjoy looks like for years to come.  Our customers love us   More than 5 of our customers have started agencies as a side business helping others learn how to use Overjoy. One joined our team full-time!  We’re growing fast   We’ve doubled revenue in the past 3 months and are on track to hit 1M by end of 2025. We're scaling quickly — and so will your impact.     Why you shouldn’t join  This isn’t a 9-to-5 job   We’re doing hard things with a small team, and it’s intense. We won’t sugarcoat that.  You’ll take full ownership and responsibility   You won’t just execute. You’ll identify problems, shape solutions, and be accountable for what you build. That level of autonomy can be exciting, but also stressful — and it’s not for everyone.  You’ll wear a lot of hats   You’ll be expected to step outside of your lane — helping with support, onboarding, and product QA — often with little guidance. If you prefer clearly defined roles and boundaries, this might not be the right environment.  Perks & Benefits  Competitive salary + meaningful equity Health, dental, and vision insurance (U.S.) Free lunch & dinner around the office Generous budget for laptops, monitors, and other office equipment"
Full-Stack Software Engineer (New graduates: United States),Wanderlog,https://www.linkedin.com/company/wanderlog/life,,1 hour ago,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4332395333/?eBP=NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CHARGING&refId=aDZDshRJaTIZfPk%2BvnnCzw%3D%3D&trackingId=Li3L%2FIlb6jiBc%2BElCG4vTw%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_search_srp_jobs,,5694,"About the job  Warning: if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.  Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.  Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.  We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self-sustaining, default-alive startup.  We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.  What You’ll Do  As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:   Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.) Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it! Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web. Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested. Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows. Review code written by other engineers. Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.   This position is a full-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.  What You Might Work On   New, user-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier. AI-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention. Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones. A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels. Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them. A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.   You May Be a Good Fit If You   Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native. Are a product person: you’ve built products end-to-end before, and really care about the people who use them. Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too. Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats. Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.   What’s it like to work here?  We’re an engineering and product-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.  Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end-to-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.  We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.  Our hiring process  We’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half-day final-round virtual onsite via video call.  Founders  Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.  Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.  Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!"

Deployed by over 60 health plans, including many of the top 20, and representing more than 160 million lives, Machinify brings together a fully configurable and content-rich, AI-powered platform along with best-in-class expertise. We’re constantly reimagining what’s possible in our industry, creating disruptively simple, powerfully clear ways to maximize financial outcomes and drive down healthcare costs.  Location: Remote  About The Opportunity  We’re seeking a Scrum Master who combines deep delivery experience with the ability to guide teams through ambiguity, complexity, and change. In this role, you won’t just manage ceremonies — you’ll be a hands-on driver of progress who helps teams stay focused, efficient, and aligned. Our teams support healthcare payment integrity solutions for health insurance clients, and your role will be critical in helping them deliver complex, data-driven products in an environment that may be unfamiliar with formal Agile practices. You’ll adapt Agile methods to meet the needs of the team and organization, while coaching individuals and leaders to embrace structure without rigidity.  Key Responsibilities    Drive Agile Delivery: Facilitate planning, stand-ups, reviews, and retrospectives to keep teams focused on execution and delivery of value for our health insurance clients.   Coach and Mentor Teams: Support individuals and teams — especially those newer to Agile — with clear, practical coaching; help them understand the “why,” not just the “how.”   Apply Agile Pragmatically: Tailor your approach based on team maturity, business goals, and delivery constraints. You’ll flex between Scrum, Kanban, or hybrid models as appropriate.   Partner Across Functions: Collaborate closely with Product, Engineering, Data Science, QA, and Business Operations to ensure alignment and effective delivery across complex workflows.   Handle Resistance with Empathy: Help teams and stakeholders adopt new ways of working — even when there’s skepticism or pushback — by building trust and demonstrating outcomes.

Top-Tier Compensation - Competitive salary + equity in a high-growth startup. Work With the Best - Join a world-class team of engineers and builders   Our Operating Principles  Extreme Ownership   We take full responsibility for our work, outcomes, and team success. No excuses, no blame-shifting — if something needs fixing, we own it and make it better. This means stepping up, even when it’s not “your job.” If a ball is dropped, we pick it up. If a customer is unhappy, we fix it. If a process is broken, we redesign it. We don’t wait for someone else to solve it — we lead with accountability and expect the same from those around us.  Craftsmanship   Putting care and intention into every task, striving for excellence, and taking deep ownership of the quality and outcome of your work. Craftsmanship means never settling for “just fine.” We sweat the details because details compound. Whether it’s a product feature, an internal doc, or a sales call — we treat it as a reflection of our standards. We aim to deliver jaw-dropping customer experiences by being curious, meticulous, and proud of what we build — even when nobody’s watching.  We are “majos”  Be friendly & have fun with your coworkers. Always be genuine & honest, but kind. “Majo” is our way of saying: be a good human. Be approachable, helpful, and warm. We’re building something ambitious, and it’s easier (and more fun) when we enjoy the ride together. We give feedback with kindness, challenge each other with respect, and celebrate wins together without ego.  Urgency with Focus  Create the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. Move fast, but in the right direction. We operate with speed because time is our most limited resource. But speed without focus is chaos. We prioritize ruthlessly, act decisively, and stay aligned. We aim for high leverage: the biggest results from the simplest, smartest actions. We’re running a high-speed marathon — not a sprint with no strategy.  Talent Density and Meritocracy  Hire only people who can raise the average; ‘exceptional performance is the passing grade.’ Ability trumps seniority. We believe the best teams are built on talent density — every hire should raise the bar. We reward contribution, not titles or tenure. We give ownership to those who earn it, and we all hold each other to a high standard. A-players want to work with other A-players — that’s how we win.  First-Principles Thinking  Strip a problem to physics-level facts, ignore industry dogma, rebuild the solution from scratch. We don’t copy-paste solutions. We go back to basics, ask why things are the way they are, and rebuild from the ground up if needed. This mindset pushes us to innovate, challenge stale assumptions, and move faster than incumbents. It’s how we build what others think is impossible.  The personal data provided in your application and during the selection process will be processed by Happyrobot, Inc., acting as Data Controller.

You’ll work directly with our CTO and the engineering team to build new features, guide technical decisions, and raise the bar for engineering quality and speed. This will be a dynamic role with responsibilities ranging from building technical systems to supporting our engaged customers. It's a perfect fit for someone excited to move fast, own outcomes end-to-end, and shape the foundation of a product and company that’s already delivering meaningful value to enterprise customers.  This is a highly collaborative, full-stack role, ideal for a builder who loves shipping, mentoring, and improving systems as much as writing great code.

You can work remotely while joining in-person sessions and off-sites You'll receive a generous cash comp, equity, and bonus opportunity.     About Incompass Labs  Talent is the #1 competitive advantage for companies operating in the knowledge economy. Why then, are the systems for assessing and developing this talent so bad?  Take the performance review process: it requires weeks or months (and many hours, from many people) to complete; the information employees receive back is incomplete and mostly unhelpful; the process relies on managers (who, like all of us, have biases and their own agendas) to spot future talent; and leaders are left with unreliable data on which to base investment decisions. At best, this is a huge waste of time; at worst, this leads to the wrong people staying in a job, while the right people leave.  Incompass’s platform uses AI and data science to enable organizations to complete performance review cycles in weeks not months; it delivers reliable assessments that help companies retain key contributors and spot future talent; and provides individuals with the support they need to own their development.  Founded by Wharton School professors, Incompass is positioned to deliver a solution that works, in a space that is ripe for disruption. We are growing fast, and just closed another successful round of fundraising, backed by industry leaders in business and HR. Join us in our mission to reimagine how organizations build teams and grow their people."

Today, 60 million Americans living in rural communities are facing a crisis of access to care. In the U.S. healthcare system, rural Americans experience significantly poorer clinical outcomes. This trend is rapidly accelerating as rural hospitals close and physician shortages increase, exacerbating health disparities. In fact, Americans living in rural communities suffer a mortality rate 23 percent higher than those in urban communities, in part because of the lack of access to quality care.  Our vision is care that enables everyone to achieve their best health. So, we’re creating a new healthcare delivery model that is purpose-built for rural America and directly addresses the issues that have historically limited access and quality. Homeward supports Medicare-eligible beneficiaries by partnering with health plans, providers, and communities to align incentives – taking full financial accountability for clinical outcomes and the total cost of care across rural counties.  As a public benefit corporation and Certified B Corp™, Homeward’s mission and business model are aligned to address the healthcare, economic, and demographic challenges that make it challenging for rural Americans to stay healthy. Our Homeward Navigation™ platform uses advanced analytics to connect members to the right care and local resources that address social determinants of health and improve holistic health outcomes. Since many rural communities lack adequate clinical capacity, Homeward also employs care teams that supplement local practices and reach people who cannot otherwise access care.  Homeward is co-founded by a leadership team that defined and delivered Livongo’s products, and backed most recently by a $50 million series B co-led by Arch Ventures and Human Capital, with participation from General Catalyst for a total of $70 million in funding. With this leadership team and funding, Homeward is committed to bringing high-quality healthcare to rural communities in need.

Prove your architectural standards are effective and pragmatic through hands-on implementation. Containerization & Orchestration: Validate containerization and orchestration approaches during architectural reviews; align implementations with golden paths.

Om jobbet  I Bo-Vejle arbejder vi ud fra vores kerneopgave, som er at understøtte et værdigt liv på egne præmisser for den enkelte borger. Et værdigt liv på egne præmisser er først og fremmest et liv med selvbestemmelse, hvor borgerne træffer sine egne valg.

Derfor er vores udgangspunkt altid med øje for borgerens ønsker.  I Bo-Vejles 11 bofællesskaber bor 130 fantastiske borgere med forskellige fysiske- og psykiske handicaps. Fælles for dem er, at de har individuelle behov, som den socialpædagogiske støtte tager udgangspunkt i.  På Grundet Bygade 19B bor der 14 skønne velfungerende borgere hvor enkelte ønsker et godnat og sov godt opkald, andre et godmorgen kald, nogle støtte til morgenrutiner såsom bad og tandbørstning mv.   Derudover består opgaverne om natten af; praktiske rengøringsopgaver, tøjvask mv. Der er en kollega på afdelingen ved siden af og man er derved ikke alene på matriklen.
