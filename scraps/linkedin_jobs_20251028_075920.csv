By recording, analyzing, and indexing conversations, our platform supplies unparalleled alpha to the critical, physical businesses that constitute the backbone of our economy.  Our purpose is to bring the technology of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the rest of the economy.  As a side effect of this mission, we’ve become one of the fastest growing companies in history. In numbers, that means 0→$40M in 3.5 years, growing 15% MoM, Net Revenue Retention above 170%, an NPS higher than the iPhone’s, and profitability.  The Role  Rilla engineers architect and ship features across the stack at lightning speed.

As an early technical steward, you will raise the bar for code quality and decision‑making, setting patterns that cement a world‑class engineering culture as we scale.

You thrive with extreme accountability, learning as a team, and both giving and receiving rapid feedback. Extreme empathy. Our customers are not tech companies. They live and work in the real world. Empathy is critical to arriving at correct solutions. Unafraid of failure. You take risks. You see failure as an opportunity to learn, grow, and be better the next time. In a weird way, you trick your brain into being excited when you fail, because it means you got a new opportunity to learn more.   What We Require   Strong coding skills with demonstrated proficiency in programming languages, such as Javascript, C++, Python, Rust, or similar languages. Strong engineering prowess, ideally developed at start-ups. Familiarity with storage and data processing systems, cloud infrastructure, and other technical tools. Strong written and verbal communication skills and ability to iterate quickly with teammates, incorporating feedback and holding a high bar for quality.

Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.  In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.  About The Role  Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work. To that end, our ambitious goal is to transform Notion into the first of its kind—a shared experience where teams, people, and AI create their life's work, together. Our team focuses on improving our users' most frequent interactions within the Notion app: navigating their workspace, discovering relevant information, and working together effectively. We maintain and iterate on key building blocks of the collaboration experience, including the sidebar, inbox, notification and digest emails, comments, home page, and more.  We are at a unique and exciting turning point in Notion's journey, with two foundational shifts in customer needs. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented growth in the scale and complexity of our users' content and collaboration requirements. On the other, we are reimagining from the ground up our users' workflows in the AI era. To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.  We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision. In this role, you will directly contribute to core building blocks of Notion's user experience, and will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that can scale to individual users and large organizations alike.  What You'll Achieve   You'll lead strategic projects that improve Notion’s core user experience. You will work with cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to develop a product and technical vision that makes software toolmaking intuitive and scalable for all. You will drive execution on the team to deliver high-quality features to our users. You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more. You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions. You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.   Skills You'll Need To Bring   Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers. Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members. Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates. Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.   Nice To Haves   You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.   We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply.

The Security team protects OpenAI’s technology, people, and products. We are technical in what we build but operational in how we execute, and we support every product and research effort at OpenAI. Our tenets include prioritizing for impact, enabling researchers and developers, preparing for future transformative technologies, and fostering a strong, collaborative security culture.  About The Role  OpenAI is seeking a Security Software Engineer to join the Infrastructure Security (InfraSec) team.  InfraSec safeguards the core of OpenAI’s research and production environments—GPU supercomputing clusters, multi-cloud infrastructure, datacenters, networking, storage, and the critical services that power our frontier AI models. Our charter spans everything from bare-metal hardware and firmware to Kubernetes clusters, service meshes, and the data pathways that carry highly sensitive model weights and user data.  As a Security Software Engineer, you will design and build critical foundational services, such as authentication systems, egress/ingress proxies, access brokers, and key management platforms, that demand high standards of reliability, scalability, and software craftsmanship. These systems form the security backbone of OpenAI’s supercomputing environment and must remain robust under intense scale and adversarial pressure.  In This Role, You Will   Architect and implement production-grade security services (e.g., auth services, access brokers, secure proxies, key-management infrastructure) that provide strong guarantees across hardware, operating systems, Kubernetes, networks, and CI/CD. Partner with infrastructure and research engineers to embed security into high-performance compute clusters, enabling rapid model training and deployment without compromising protection. Develop automation and detection tooling to continuously identify and mitigate risks in large-scale cloud and on-prem environments. Drive high-impact initiatives such as line-speed encryption, machine identity, and network isolation, continuously raising the security bar for emerging AI workloads. Lead or participate in design reviews and threat models to ensure new systems launch with strong security foundations and operational excellence.   You Will Thrive In This Role If You Have   Strong software engineering skills in languages such as Python, Go, Rust, or C/C++, with a track record of shipping and operating high-reliability distributed services. Experience building or operating critical security infrastructure (e.g., auth services, service-to-service proxies, certificate or key-management systems). Deep understanding of security principles, best practices, and common vulnerabilities. Expertise in securing large-scale cloud platforms (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP), including multi-cloud networks and cloud-agnostic system design. Familiarity with container and orchestration security (Kubernetes, service meshes) and modern authentication/authorization standards (OIDC, mTLS, SPIFFE/SPIRE). A proactive mindset, with the ability to identify and address security gaps or inefficiencies through automation and tooling. A track record of delivering scalable solutions and driving impactful changes across infrastructure in real-world projects. Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with an ability to think critically and objectively assess security risks. Excellent communication skills, with the ability to convey complex security concepts to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Excitement about collaborating with cross-functional teams to build secure, reliable systems that scale globally.   About OpenAI  OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity.  We are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

In addition, job duties require access to secure and protected information technology systems and related data security obligations.

A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.  To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.  For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.  A few examples of your responsibilities Master your toolkit. By working across diverse tech stacks, you’ll refine your ability to choose the right tools for every challenge. From monolithic to microservices architectures, gRPC to REST APIs, Kubernetes to Docker, Python to Rust—you’ll show that true expertise isn’t about using the trendiest technologies, but about understanding their purpose to unleash their full potential. Build stuff that matters. Regardless of your seniority, you’ll enjoy plenty of autonomy and take full ownership of your work, from ideation to execution. You’ll have the unique opportunity to build software from the ground up and witness firsthand how your code evolves into a product used at scale. Simplify relentlessly. Is every component essential? Do we need this process? As a Bending Spoons engineer, your mission is to turn complexity into simplicity. Whether optimizing CI/CD pipelines, writing maintainable code, or crafting minimalist architectures, your drive to simplify will power scalable, future-proof solutions.   What we look for Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter. Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar. Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent. Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.   What we offer Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field. An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too. Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer individuals at the start of their career a salary of £83,997 in London and €63,965 elsewhere in Europe. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £194,964 in London, and €105,737 and €186,748 elsewhere in Europe. Compensation varies by location and expected impact, and grows rapidly as you gain experience and translate it into greater contributions. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut. All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.   Commitment & contract Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time.  Location Milan (Italy), London (UK), Madrid (Spain), Warsaw (Poland) or remote.  The selection process If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests designed to assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. They’re challenging and may take several hours to complete. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews.  We set the bar high and won't extend an offer until we're convinced we've found the right candidate. This is why a job may stay open for months or be reposted several times.  Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.  Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and provide reasonable accommodations for an individual with disabilities—just let us know through this form.  Before you apply If you’ve applied before but didn't receive an offer, we recommend waiting at least one year before applying again.  Bending Spoons is a demanding environment. We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment.  To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance.

Postman is the world’s leading API platform, used by more than 40 million developers and 500,000 organizations, including 98% of the Fortune 500. Postman is helping developers and professionals across the globe build the API-first world by simplifying each step of the API lifecycle and streamlining collaboration—enabling users to create better APIs, faster.  The company is headquartered in San Francisco and has offices in Boston, New York, and Bangalore - where Postman was founded. Postman is privately held, with funding from Battery Ventures, BOND, Coatue, CRV, Insight Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Learn more at postman.com or connect with Postman on X via @getpostman.  P.S: We highly recommend reading The ""API-First World"" graphic novel to understand the bigger picture and our vision at Postman.  The Opportunity  Please note: we at Postman try to keep levels flat so that engineering is a meritocracy. So if you see yourself or call yourself a “Senior Engineer,” an “Engineer,” or something in between, please consider applying and we’ll calibrate on level, experience, and team needs in the interview panel!  The API client is the core beating heart of the Postman product experience. It is what many users perceive as the entirety of Postman (although there is so much more!), and we have ambitious goals in 2024 and beyond to delight developers and simplify this central product experience. As part of this, we're looking for a Backend Engineer to bring depth, craft, and resilience to the infrastructure that underpins it all.  We Have Three Major Thematic Goals We’re Pursuing On The API Client Team And You’ll Be a Key Contributor In Realizing Them   Delight the Developer. The developer is central to Postman’s mission. We intend to meet them where they are—faster feedback cycles, GitHub-first thinking, and intuitive features that anticipate their needs and respect their time. Simplify request sending and debugging. Postman’s power is immense—but we must distill that power into a smooth, low-friction experience that makes common tasks effortless and advanced workflows discoverable when needed. Build the multi-protocol future. Postman isn’t just about REST anymore. We’re investing deeply in modern protocols—GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets—and tying them together into a seamless, end-to-end experience.   Behind every fast, reliable API call made in Postman is a constellation of backend systems doing the heavy lifting—executing code, orchestrating local runtimes, syncing data, collecting telemetry, and providing rock-solid observability. That’s where you come in.  About You   Have 8+ years of backend engineering experience, with a strong foundation in Node.js and/or Golang. Have deep expertise and experience in Kubernetes, Docker, Grafana, and modern CI/CD infrastructure Have built, maintained, and scaled distributed systems in production environments. Think in systems: you’re passionate about observability, reliability, performance, and ensuring that these are understood by everyone on the team as it relates to our backend systems. Can navigate legacy codebases and leave them better than you found them. Communicate clearly and effectively especially in async and distributed team settings. See beyond your function. You’re not just writing backend code, you’re building a product experience you believe in.   Nice-to-Haves   Familiarity with distributed tracing tools (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger). Knowledge of CRDTs, real-time systems, or collaborative libraries and technologies like yjs Past experience in developer tools or API platforms.   Why This Role?   The API Client is used by 80% of Postman users—your work directly impacts the daily workflows of millions of developers. You’ll shape foundational infrastructure for one of the most loved products in the dev ecosystem. You’ll join a world-class team that prizes execution, engineering rigor, and solving real user problems—not just shipping code.   The reasonably estimated base salary for this role ranges from $210,000 to $240,000, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is based on the candidate's skills, qualifications, and experience.  What Else?  In addition to Postman's pay-on-performance philosophy, and a flexible schedule working with a fun, collaborative team, Postman offers a comprehensive set of benefits, including full medical coverage, flexible PTO, wellness reimbursement, and a monthly lunch stipend. Along with that, our wellness programs will help you stay in the best of your physical and mental health. Our frequent and fascinating team-building events will keep you connected, while our donation-matching program can support the causes you care about. We’re building a long-term company with an inclusive culture where everyone can be the best version of themselves.  At Postman, we embrace a hybrid work model. For all roles based out of San Francisco Bay Area, Boston, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and New York, employees are expected to come into the office 3-days a week. We were thoughtful in our approach which is based on balancing flexibility and collaboration and grounded in feedback from our workforce, leadership team, and peers. The benefits of our hybrid office model will be shared knowledge, brainstorming sessions, communication, and building trust in-person that cannot be replicated via zoom.  Our Values  At Postman, we create with the same curiosity that we see in our users. We value transparency and honest communication about not only successes, but also failures. In our work, we focus on specific goals that add up to a larger vision. Our inclusive work culture ensures that everyone is valued equally as important pieces of our final product. We are dedicated to delivering the best products we can.  Equal opportunity  Postman is an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer.

About This Role  We’re in a unique position at Astronomer: as the company behind Apache Airflow, we see data as it moves across entire organizations - from raw ingestion to production dashboards, machine learning models, and AI products. Leveraging this vantage point, our R&D team recently released an AI-empowered IDE for data - an intelligence layer that powers search and discovery, and code generation for data engineering and analytics. LLMs are already quite good at writing Python and SQL code against data platforms; the Astro IDE gives data practitioners everywhere a better path to use LLMs effectively for their specific day-to-day use.  As a Design Engineer on the team, you’ll create designs and build the user experience for the Astro IDE, our new AI enabled software IDE built specifically for Data Engineers. The IDE poses a few interesting design challenges: it’s a simplified IDE built specifically for writing data pipelines and comes with built-in experiences around testing data pipelines.

In today's world of endless apps and tabs, Notion provides one place for teams to get everything done, seamlessly connecting docs, notes, projects, calendar, and email—with AI built in to find answers and automate work. Millions of users, from individuals to large organizations like Toyota, Figma, and OpenAI, love Notion for its flexibility and choose it because it helps them save time and money.  In-person collaboration is essential to Notion's culture. We require all team members to work from our offices on Mondays and Thursdays, our designated Anchor Days. Certain teams or positions may require additional in-office workdays.  About The Role  Teamwork's mission is to make Notion the best collaborative environment for knowledge work. To that end, our ambitious goal is to transform Notion into the first of its kind—a shared experience where teams, people, and AI create their life's work, together. Our team focuses on improving our users' most frequent interactions within the Notion app: navigating their workspace, discovering relevant information, and working together effectively. We maintain and iterate on key building blocks of the collaboration experience, including the sidebar, inbox, notification and digest emails, comments, home page, and more.  We are at a unique and exciting turning point in Notion's journey, with two foundational shifts in customer needs. On one hand, we are witnessing unprecedented growth in the scale and complexity of our users' content and collaboration requirements. On the other, we are reimagining from the ground up our users' workflows in the AI era. To address these challenges, we are taking a step back to rethink Notion's core information architecture and develop a new foundation that will support our users' needs for the next decade.  We are looking for passionate full stack product engineers to help us build this vision. In this role, you will directly contribute to core building blocks of Notion's user experience, and will be a key player in building a robust technical foundation that can scale to individual users and large organizations alike.  What You'll Achieve   You'll lead strategic projects that improve Notion’s core user experience. You will work with cross-functional partners across product, design, data science, and user research to develop a product and technical vision that makes software toolmaking intuitive and scalable for all. You will drive execution on the team to deliver high-quality features to our users. You’ll build and maintain foundational pieces of Notion’s building blocks, enabling a wide array of use cases in Notion such as docs, wikis, issue tracking, project management, and more. You’ll contribute to the overall performance, reliability, and robustness of the Notion product, ensuring it scales elegantly across many dimensions. You’ll partner with engineering leaders to identify and execute against high leverage technical investment that ensure the long-term flexibility and sustainability of our core systems.   Skills You'll Need To Bring   Proven track record of execution: You have 7+ years of engineering experience, including several years building world-class product experiences alongside a team of engineers. Tech leadership experience: You have previously held positions where you were responsible for making key technical decisions, guiding a team through complex projects, and mentoring junior team members. Shipping quality user interfaces: You partner closely with product and design to craft beautiful user experiences for large audiences, leveraging web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus. Building the team: You enjoy collaborating with both fellow engineers and cross-functional partners. You are a lifelong learner and invest in both your own growth, but also the growth, learning, and development of your teammates. Thoughtful problem-solving: You approach problems holistically, starting with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it will impact real people's lives. You can navigate ambiguity flawlessly, decompose complex problems into clean solutions, while also balancing the business impact of what you’re building. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.   Nice To Haves   You're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work. You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.   We hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.  Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
