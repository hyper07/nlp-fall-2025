This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders. We’ve redefined static analysis tooling by committing to all of these, and turned our project, Semgrep, into an essential safeguard for code at Snowflake, Dropbox, and more.  About The Role  As a full stack engineer on Semgrep’s Supply Chain team, you’ll build customer-facing tools to help developers secure their software from vulnerabilities introduced by dependencies. Other supply chain management tools exist, but they produce far too much noise to be useful or efficient. Security teams may file through thousands of vulnerabilities, informing developers that hundreds of their dependencies have introduced critical vulnerabilities and need updating, when in reality they are not even using those dependencies in a vulnerable way. Perhaps you’ve even felt this pain yourself!  Our goal is to cut through the noise: to make it easy to find and remediate the 2% of vulnerabilities that are actually reachable given the way our customers’ use their dependencies. We work to make supply chain security as simple and intuitive for our users as possible so developers can focus on their own mission.  You’ll learn about the application-security space, mentor more junior developers, collaborate with product managers and other engineers to create security tools our customers love, architect systems for storing and maintaining sensitive data, and help us surface those data back to our users to help them understand their individual security posture. Through Semgrep’s culture of transparency, you’ll see and influence the decisions that make a startup successful. Your decisions will be key to making Semgrep a world-leading static-analysis project, giving you lasting influence not only at Semgrep, but in the world’s developer community.  You will:   Work on major product initiatives end-to-end, from user-research through design, implementation, and deployment Help set technical and product direction, collaborating with the team to determine the future of the product, what features to build, and how to build them Learn from users to understand their needs, build products to help keep them secure, and work with them to help them scale their security programs Advocate for and develop intuitive, simple, robust APIs that solve a wide variety of complex problems using simple, elegant abstractions Ensure continual, high-availability operation of services using modern site-reliability practices, including participation in an on-call rotation Advise and mentor other engineers via thoughtful code reviews, planning discussions, technical documentation, and formal mentorship   You are ideal for this role if you have:   5+ years of experience writing production software and building web applications. Our stack includes Python, Typescript, and Postgres Excitement about building for customers, learning their needs, iterating fast, and seeing your solutions solve their core problems Excellent and proactive communication, both verbal and written   Some examples projects you might work on include:   Identify which of a user’s dependencies would fix the highest number of downstream vulnerabilities when upgraded Build data flow and call graphs to determine whether vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies are even reachable from users’ code Collect and expose health metrics on open source dependencies to help keep users’ software free of poorly maintained, low quality, and malicious packages Flag vulnerable dependencies in developer IDEs as they are used and prevent them from ever making it to production   This position is preffered to go into an office 2-3 days/week.  Compensation  Salary Range: $176,000-207,000  Our compensation package includes equity and benefits in addition to salary.  Please note that the range listed is for someone based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  What We Offer  Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every Semgrep employee with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.  We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or something else.  Who We Are  We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We’re new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both.  Semgrep is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds.

We’re starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers’ doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.  To date, The Farmer’s Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.  #LongLiveDogs  What We Stand For And Where You'll Come In  Our engineering org is growing, creating fresh opportunities to solve complex, high-impact problems at scale. This role is part of that growth: a chance to shape how we build, collaborate, and lead as we take on bigger challenges.  As a Senior Engineering Manager, you’ll lead a group of engineers (we call them pawds 🐾) focused on delivering impactful software that delivers seamless and delightful cross-platform experiences that build confidence and trust with our customers. Your role is to ensure both the short and long term success of the pawd: finding a balance of delivering impactful projects for the business, continuously improving Engineering processes, and supporting individuals grow through their careers. You’ll co-own pawd roadmaps in deep partnership with Product Managers and Product Designers while collaborating cross-functionally to ensure we’re solving the right problems and bringing experiences to life in quick iteration.  You’ll embody our values and working principles, leading by example, instilling them in your pawd all while staying close to your customer. We work with a modern tech stack, including Node.js, TypeScript, AWS, Docker, Terraform, Temporal, and Postgres, and are looking for engineers excited to dive into these technologies and help us push them further.  One Team: We don’t think of ourselves as “Acquisition Marketers”, “Engineers”, “Data Analysts”, or “Product Managers”. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don’t think departments matter. We’d rather align ourselves to the goals we’re working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems together – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.  We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren’t tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there’s a better or more impactful way to solve problems.  We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.  We Execute For Impact: We don’t subscribe to “best practices” or “industry KPIs”. We’re uninterested in how we compare to “benchmarks”; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don’t subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.  We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, “what’s the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?”. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don’t expect to be perfect the first time.  How You'll Make An Impact   Grow and support multiple engineering pawds through thoughtful hiring, onboarding, mentoring, coaching, and continuous feedback to set them and the function up for long term success Create an environment of high trust, ownership, and clarity where engineers are proud of their work and aligned on priorities Partner with Staff and Senior engineers to guide technical direction, ensuring scalable systems, clean architecture, and strong engineering craft Promote a culture of learning through architecture reviews, incident reviews, and peer mentorship (including coaching other engineering managers and senior+ engineers) Partner with product managers to shape strategy and roadmaps, adapt priorities and deliver meaningful outcomes Ensure your pawds’ work aligns with company goals and customer impact Drive the evolution of our engineering organization by improving how we hire, build, and collaborate across pawds Operate with urgency and intentionality by moving quickly and focusing on the right problems while improving how we work   We're Excited About You Because   You have 7+ years of software engineering experience You have 5+ years of engineering management experience leading a high-performing team, supporting day-to-day execution, setting goals, and coaching for growth and development You have experience efficiently delegating group responsibilities, conducting 1:1’s, managing performance and providing frequent, clear, actionable feedback You lead with curiosity and ownership to align the team, remove friction, and ensure your pawd’s work directly improves the customer experience  You have proven ability architecting for high-scalability and availability You have a customer-centric mentality and experience collaborating with product, design, data, and other key stakeholders You are able to thrive in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, prioritize effectively, are naturally curious and a proactive self-starter, constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and solutions You're a skilled communicator and have the ability to absorb and distill complexity into simple terms to drive decision making You love dogs   Office Guidelines  We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space.

As an organization we are full of individuals who are unique in many ways, but all united in a mission of providing true peace of mind to dog lovers everywhere.

We believe the best use of our time, energy, and resources as a collective team is to focus on this mission, and on supporting our team to do their best work and be their best selves.

Join our pack and come work (and play!) with us.  We believe everyone deserves the unconditional love of a pet—and at Rover, our mission is to make it easier to experience that love. Founded in 2011, the Rover app and website connect dog and cat parents with loving pet sitters and dog walkers in neighborhoods across the US, Canada, and Europe. We empower our community of trusted pet sitters and dog walkers to run their own pet care businesses on Rover with the tools and security of a global company to back them.

With a dual mandate to accelerate researchers and enable frontier scale, we’re building a unified, modular runtime that meets researchers where they are and moves with them up the scaling curve.  Our work focuses on three pillars: high-performance, asynchronous, zero-copy tensor and optimizer-state-aware data movement; performant, high-uptime, fault-tolerant training frameworks (training loop, state management, resilient checkpointing, deterministic orchestration, and observability); and distributed process management for long-lived, job-specific and user-provided processes.  We integrate proven large-scale capabilities into a composable, developer-facing runtime so teams can iterate quickly and run reliably at any scale, partnering closely with model-stack, research, and platform teams. Success for us is measured by raising both training throughput (how fast models train) and researcher throughput (how fast ideas become experiments and products).  About The Role  As a Training: ML Framework Engineer, you will work on improving the training throughput for our internal training framework, while enabling researchers to experiment with new ideas. This requires good engineering (for example designing, implementing, and optimizing state-of-the-art AI models), writing bug-free machine learning code (surprisingly difficult!), and acquiring deep knowledge of the performance of supercomputers. In all the projects this role pursues, the ultimate goal is to push the field forward.  We’re looking for people who love optimizing performance, understanding distributed systems, and who cannot stand having bugs in their code. Since our training framework is used for large runs with massive numbers of GPUs, performance improvements here will have a large impact.  This role is based in San Francisco, CA. We use a hybrid work model of 3 days in the office per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.  In This Role, You Will   Apply the latest techniques in our internal training framework to achieve impressive hardware efficiency for our training runs Profile and optimize our training framework Work with researchers to enable them to develop the next generation of models   You Might Thrive In This Role If You   Have run small scale ML experiments Love figuring out how systems work and continuously come up with ideas for how to make them faster while minimizing complexity and maintenance burden Have strong software engineering skills and are proficient in Python   About OpenAI  OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company dedicated to ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. We push the boundaries of the capabilities of AI systems and seek to safely deploy them to the world through our products. AI is an extremely powerful tool that must be created with safety and human needs at its core, and to achieve our mission, we must encompass and value the many different perspectives, voices, and experiences that form the full spectrum of humanity.  We are an equal opportunity employer, and we do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability, genetic information, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

We believe that security should be monitored and verified continuously, and we empower companies to practice better security and prove it with ease. Vanta has a kind and talented team, and while some have prior security experience, many have been successful at Vanta without it.  We’re a dynamic company looking to break the mold—pushing our advertising beyond the conventional boundaries of typical SaaS and B2B campaigns.  We’re looking for a Senior Motion Designer to join the Brand Creative team and lead how Vanta shows up through motion. This is an opportunity to define and own the company’s motion identity: how our brand animates, transitions, and tells stories across web, social, and video.  This role is perfect for a very experienced, hands-on motion designer who can both set a creative direction and bring it to life through craft. You’ll help build Vanta’s motion guidelines, design and animate campaigns, and edit short-form video content for social media and web.  Vanta’s brand sits at the intersection of trust and wit. We speak about serious topics like security and compliance, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. The ideal candidate has a sense of humor and an instinct for timing. They’re able to bring playfulness and human warmth into motion while maintaining polish and clarity.  You’ll collaborate closely with designers, copywriters, and marketing partners to bring motion ideas to life. You’ll also establish scalable systems and processes that make motion a core part of how the brand communicates.  What you’ll do as a Senior Motion Designer at Vanta:   Define and develop Vanta’s motion system, creating a distinctive motion identity that translates across web, social, product, and video. Concept, storyboard, design, and animate assets for brand campaigns, website experiences, and marketing channels. Edit short-form video content (e.g., social reels, sizzle videos, campaign trailers) using brand-aligned storytelling. Bring personality to serious subjects through tone, timing, and creative storytelling. Collaborate closely with the brand design, copy, and growth teams to deliver motion that elevates and humanizes our brand. Create motion templates, libraries, and documentation. Partner with external vendors, editors, or animators. Work and experiment with new tools and techniques, including generative AI. Actively advocate for motion as a storytelling tool at Vanta, identifying for when and how it can create impact.   How to be successful in this role:   BFA in motion design, graphic design, animation, or a related field. 10+ years of experience in motion design, including at least 5 years within in-house brand or creative teams. A strong portfolio demonstrating mastery of animation, storytelling, pacing, and design fundamentals, with examples that show a sense of humor or narrative wit. Expert proficiency in After Effects, Premiere Pro, and other industry-standard tools. Familiarity with audio editing and sound design for motion. Basic understanding of web animation implementation (Lottie, Webflow, etc.). Experience editing short-form video for digital and social platforms. Working knowledge of generative AI tools for ideation, storyboarding, or animation. Strong understanding of brand systems and how motion reinforces identity. Excellent communication and presentation skills. Proactive, self-directed, and able to balance craft with efficiency. Able to manage own timelines, workflows, and deliverables for multiple projects simultaneously. Bonus points: Experience with 3D design and animation tools (e.g., Cinema 4D, Blender).  What you can expect as a Vantan:   Industry-competitive compensation 100% covered medical, dental, and vision benefits with dependents coverage 16 weeks fully-paid parental Leave for all new parents Health & wellness and remote workplace stipends Family planning benefits through Carrot Fertility 401(k) matching Flexible work hours and location Open PTO policy 11 paid holidays in the US Offices in SF, NYC, London, Dublin, and Sydney   To provide greater transparency to candidates, we share base pay ranges for all US-based job postings regardless of state. We set standard base pay ranges for all roles based on function, level, and country location, benchmarked against similar-stage growth companies. Final offer amounts are determined by multiple factors and may vary based on candidate location, skills, depth of work experience, and relevant licenses/credentials.  At Vanta, we are committed to hiring diverse talent of different backgrounds and as such, it is important to us to provide an inclusive work environment for all. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, gender identity, age, religion, sexual orientation, veteran or disability status, or any other protected class. As an equal opportunity employer, we encourage and welcome people of all backgrounds to apply.  About Vanta  We started in 2018, in the wake of several high-profile data breaches. Online security was only becoming more important, but we knew firsthand how hard it could be for fast-growing companies to invest the time and manpower it takes to build a solid security foundation. Vanta was inspired by a vision to restore trust in internet businesses by enabling companies to improve and prove their security. From our early days automating security monitoring for compliance standards like SOC 2, HIPAA and ISO 27001 to creating the world's leading Trust Management Platform, our vision remains unchanged.  Now more than ever, making security continuous—not just a point-in-time check— is essential. Thousands of companies rely on Vanta to build, maintain and demonstrate their trust— all in a way that's real-time and transparent.  "

Focus on best practices for all layers – UI, API, and Workers, ensuring well-crafted technology delivery to achieve business objectives both functional and non-functional.

This is a critical role in that journey, and it will require someone who has a true passion for software development in the logistics space.  Primary Responsibilities:   Build the best technology solutions within the “Guiding Light” architecture: Evolve our core platform into a modular monolith or service-based design with clear separation of concerns based upon the architectural vision while remaining agile and adaptive to change. Build for change without disruption: Ensuring uninterrupted business operations as solutions migrate; integrate the codebase without disrupting existing development. Ensure engineering discipline: Build mechanisms to provide feedback and utilize that feedback to verify adherence to best practices. Collaborate across the organization: Partner with product, engineering, and leadership to align architecture decisions with strategic goals. Continuous improvement: Use feedback from implementation teams to refine designs and improve scalability, maintainability, and delivery velocity.   Education and Work Experience:   Extensive experience delivering enterprise systems (7+ years software development, 3+ years in a senior role). Deep understanding of DDD, Clean Architecture, and modern modular or service-oriented design. Hands-on experience with Java, Node.js, React, and relational databases like MS SQL Server (or similar languages, frameworks, and databases). Strong understanding of modern delivery practices, including CI/CD, containerization, and cloud-native approaches. Proven ability to design migration and cutover strategies that minimize risk and disruption. Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to influence across teams and departments.   Why Lineage?  This is an excellent position to begin your career path within Lineage! Success in this role enables greater responsibilities and promotions! A career at Lineage starts with learning about our business and how each team member plays a part each and every day to satisfy our customers’ requirements.

We’re starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers’ doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.  To date, The Farmer’s Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.  #LongLiveDogs  What We Stand For And Where You'll Come In  Our engineering org is growing, creating fresh opportunities to solve complex, high-impact problems at scale. This role is part of that growth: a chance to shape how we build, collaborate, and lead as we take on bigger challenges.  As a Senior Engineering Manager, you’ll lead a group of engineers (we call them pawds 🐾) focused on delivering impactful software that delivers seamless and delightful cross-platform experiences that build confidence and trust with our customers. Your role is to ensure both the short and long term success of the pawd: finding a balance of delivering impactful projects for the business, continuously improving Engineering processes, and supporting individuals grow through their careers. You’ll co-own pawd roadmaps in deep partnership with Product Managers and Product Designers while collaborating cross-functionally to ensure we’re solving the right problems and bringing experiences to life in quick iteration.  You’ll embody our values and working principles, leading by example, instilling them in your pawd all while staying close to your customer. We work with a modern tech stack, including Node.js, TypeScript, AWS, Docker, Terraform, Temporal, and Postgres, and are looking for engineers excited to dive into these technologies and help us push them further.  One Team: We don’t think of ourselves as “Acquisition Marketers”, “Engineers”, “Data Analysts”, or “Product Managers”. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don’t think departments matter. We’d rather align ourselves to the goals we’re working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems together – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.  We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren’t tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there’s a better or more impactful way to solve problems.  We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.  We Execute For Impact: We don’t subscribe to “best practices” or “industry KPIs”. We’re uninterested in how we compare to “benchmarks”; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don’t subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.  We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, “what’s the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now? How do I confirm or reject that hypothesis as fast as possible?”. We rarely have timelines/deadlines and are constantly taking in new information and adjusting our priorities accordingly. We don’t expect to be perfect the first time.  How You'll Make An Impact   Grow and support multiple engineering pawds through thoughtful hiring, onboarding, mentoring, coaching, and continuous feedback to set them and the function up for long term success Create an environment of high trust, ownership, and clarity where engineers are proud of their work and aligned on priorities Partner with Staff and Senior engineers to guide technical direction, ensuring scalable systems, clean architecture, and strong engineering craft Promote a culture of learning through architecture reviews, incident reviews, and peer mentorship (including coaching other engineering managers and senior+ engineers) Partner with product managers to shape strategy and roadmaps, adapt priorities and deliver meaningful outcomes Ensure your pawds’ work aligns with company goals and customer impact Drive the evolution of our engineering organization by improving how we hire, build, and collaborate across pawds Operate with urgency and intentionality by moving quickly and focusing on the right problems while improving how we work   We're Excited About You Because   You have 7+ years of software engineering experience You have 5+ years of engineering management experience leading a high-performing team, supporting day-to-day execution, setting goals, and coaching for growth and development You have experience efficiently delegating group responsibilities, conducting 1:1’s, managing performance and providing frequent, clear, actionable feedback You lead with curiosity and ownership to align the team, remove friction, and ensure your pawd’s work directly improves the customer experience  You have proven ability architecting for high-scalability and availability You have a customer-centric mentality and experience collaborating with product, design, data, and other key stakeholders You are able to thrive in a fast-paced and ambiguous environment, prioritize effectively, are naturally curious and a proactive self-starter, constantly on the lookout for new opportunities and solutions You're a skilled communicator and have the ability to absorb and distill complexity into simple terms to drive decision making You love dogs   Office Guidelines  We are an in-office culture, made of in-office people who thrive on the collaboration and magnetism of working in a shared space. We are seeking individuals who excel in this type of environment, where being present fosters deeper connections and engagement.  Our Belonging Philosophy  Our company’s mission is rooted in deep, genuine care for dogs – and for the people who love them.
