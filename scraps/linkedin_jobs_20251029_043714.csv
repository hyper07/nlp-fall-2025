We’re starting by radically improving the $90 billion pet food industry, replacing bags of highly-processed pellets with a personalized subscription service that sends complete and balanced, freshly-made dog food directly to customers’ doors. Our ultimate goal is to create innovative, delightful and personalized experiences across all aspects of pet care, and we believe our direct-to-consumer business model, holistic approach to growth, and dynamic culture uniquely position us to shepherd this backwards industry into the future.  To date, The Farmer’s Dog has delivered over 1 billion meals nationwide and raised over $150M in funding to help us build a company as healthy as the dogs who are eating those meals. Join us as we continue to develop ways of bringing peace of mind to customers, health to their companions, and much-needed change to the way people feed and care for their pets.  #LongLiveDogs  What We Stand For And Where You'll Come In  Our engineering org is growing, creating fresh opportunities to solve complex, high-impact problems at scale. This role is part of that growth: a chance to shape how we build, collaborate, and lead as we take on bigger challenges.  As a Senior Engineering Manager, you’ll lead a group of engineers (we call them pawds 🐾) focused on delivering impactful software that delivers seamless and delightful cross-platform experiences that build confidence and trust with our customers. Your role is to ensure both the short and long term success of the pawd: finding a balance of delivering impactful projects for the business, continuously improving Engineering processes, and supporting individuals grow through their careers. You’ll co-own pawd roadmaps in deep partnership with Product Managers and Product Designers while collaborating cross-functionally to ensure we’re solving the right problems and bringing experiences to life in quick iteration.  You’ll embody our values and working principles, leading by example, instilling them in your pawd all while staying close to your customer. We work with a modern tech stack, including Node.js, TypeScript, AWS, Docker, Terraform, Temporal, and Postgres, and are looking for engineers excited to dive into these technologies and help us push them further.  One Team: We don’t think of ourselves as “Acquisition Marketers”, “Engineers”, “Data Analysts”, or “Product Managers”. Beyond denoting skill sets and areas of expertise, we don’t think departments matter. We’d rather align ourselves to the goals we’re working to achieve and make sure we have necessary subject matter expertise to drive meaningful impact. We strive to orient ourselves around customer problems together – getting the right people, with the right context, in the right rooms to solve problems holistically.  We are skeptical about everything and precious about nothing: Ideas can and should come from anywhere, and we aren’t tied to our own. We proactively source input. We talk to our customers and leads regularly and are quick to change course if we know there’s a better or more impactful way to solve problems.  We consider the customer journey in all of our decisions: We know that no interaction exists in a silo and therefore understand how important every single one is. We ensure our strategy sets prospective and new customers up for success and drives long-term retention. We answer questions and address problems early and proactively. We understand the value of different channels, initiatives, and messages and know how to articulate impact and advocate for prioritization holistically.  We Execute For Impact: We don’t subscribe to “best practices” or “industry KPIs”. We’re uninterested in how we compare to “benchmarks”; instead we orient ourselves around being the best we can possibly be. Similarly, we don’t subscribe to rigid or classical expectations of roles – i.e. acquisition is hyper-focused on improving customer retention and experience.  We Are Focused and Work Without Assumption: We are not beholden to ideas. We have goals and believe everything beyond that is a series of hypotheses to validate. To that end, we seek to work in sequence and not in parallel. We constantly ask ourselves, “what’s the most important hypothesis I should be working on right now?

This means building program analysis tools that are open source, easy to use, powerful, and fast. It also means building a team with security expertise and a passion for great developer experiences. Most of all, it means working with honesty and respect in a diverse community of dreamers and builders. We’ve redefined static analysis tooling by committing to all of these, and turned our project, Semgrep, into an essential safeguard for code at Snowflake, Dropbox, and more.  About The Role  As a full stack engineer on Semgrep’s Supply Chain team, you’ll build customer-facing tools to help developers secure their software from vulnerabilities introduced by dependencies. Other supply chain management tools exist, but they produce far too much noise to be useful or efficient. Security teams may file through thousands of vulnerabilities, informing developers that hundreds of their dependencies have introduced critical vulnerabilities and need updating, when in reality they are not even using those dependencies in a vulnerable way. Perhaps you’ve even felt this pain yourself!  Our goal is to cut through the noise: to make it easy to find and remediate the 2% of vulnerabilities that are actually reachable given the way our customers’ use their dependencies. We work to make supply chain security as simple and intuitive for our users as possible so developers can focus on their own mission.  You’ll learn about the application-security space, mentor more junior developers, collaborate with product managers and other engineers to create security tools our customers love, architect systems for storing and maintaining sensitive data, and help us surface those data back to our users to help them understand their individual security posture. Through Semgrep’s culture of transparency, you’ll see and influence the decisions that make a startup successful. Your decisions will be key to making Semgrep a world-leading static-analysis project, giving you lasting influence not only at Semgrep, but in the world’s developer community.  You will:   Work on major product initiatives end-to-end, from user-research through design, implementation, and deployment Help set technical and product direction, collaborating with the team to determine the future of the product, what features to build, and how to build them Learn from users to understand their needs, build products to help keep them secure, and work with them to help them scale their security programs Advocate for and develop intuitive, simple, robust APIs that solve a wide variety of complex problems using simple, elegant abstractions Ensure continual, high-availability operation of services using modern site-reliability practices, including participation in an on-call rotation Advise and mentor other engineers via thoughtful code reviews, planning discussions, technical documentation, and formal mentorship   You are ideal for this role if you have:   5+ years of experience writing production software and building web applications. Our stack includes Python, Typescript, and Postgres Excitement about building for customers, learning their needs, iterating fast, and seeing your solutions solve their core problems Excellent and proactive communication, both verbal and written   Some examples projects you might work on include:   Identify which of a user’s dependencies would fix the highest number of downstream vulnerabilities when upgraded Build data flow and call graphs to determine whether vulnerabilities from transitive dependencies are even reachable from users’ code Collect and expose health metrics on open source dependencies to help keep users’ software free of poorly maintained, low quality, and malicious packages Flag vulnerable dependencies in developer IDEs as they are used and prevent them from ever making it to production   This position is preffered to go into an office 2-3 days/week.  Compensation  Salary Range: $176,000-207,000  Our compensation package includes equity and benefits in addition to salary.  Please note that the range listed is for someone based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  What We Offer  Our goal is to competitively and fairly compensate every Semgrep employee with a system that equally rewards those who are vocal and those who are less comfortable making demands during the final steps of the hiring process. To that end, we generate internal compensation bands that are used when discussing and negotiating salaries. We update these based on market data to make sure they’re above the average for comparable roles.  We also invest in our employees’ well-being and long term success with comprehensive health plans, generous vacation time, 401k, learning stipends, and more. Our benefits are for everyone, so that you’re taken care of, and we work with individuals to make sure they have what they need, whether that’s quiet work space, adjusted hours, or something else.  Who We Are  We have people from France and the Philippines, physics and philosophy, formal methods research and full fledged corporations. We’re new parents and new grads, aspiring authors and aspiring Americans, dog lovers and dogfooders. We get together often to bike, bake, and meet up in parks. In our interactions, we believe respect and honesty go hand in hand, and prioritize both.  Semgrep is an equal-opportunity employer seeking a diverse range of backgrounds. We value who you are — including your cultural heritage, your socioeconomic status, your age, your race, your gender, your sexual orientation, your disabilities. We value what’s vitally important to you — your family, your religion, your politics. We value what you love in this world — your music, your weekend pursuits. We believe in welcoming varied professional backgrounds, educations, and interests. If you’re exceptional in your role, believe in Semgrep’s mission, and treat Semgrep’s values as your own, you belong here.

Job Description  Pitch — Why this role matters  Help transform Spendesk into an AI‑first spend management platform. As part of our new AI/Data squad, you’ll design and operate the services that power AI features end‑to‑end — from supplier recommendations to autonomous workflows that reduce manual toil. You’ll collaborate closely with ML Engineers, PMs, and Designers, integrating best‑in‑class models via AWS Bedrock and building reliable, scalable APIs and pipelines. This is a greenfield opportunity with real product impact and latitude to shape our architecture around agents, orchestration, and evaluations.  Role Overview  We are looking for a talented Backend Software Engineer to join our AI/Data squad and help shape the future of spend management with AI.  As a Backend Software Engineer, you will take ownership of both functional and technical topics. You will have the opportunity to work across the entire feature lifecycle, including specification, technical design, development, testing, documentation, and maintenance.  Our stack   TypeScript Node.js for backend and banking applications React on the frontend PostgreSQL for data storage; Redis, SQS, and Kafka for jobs and queues Terraform to define our infrastructure Kubernetes, Lambdas, and Step Functions to run our applications AWS as our cloud provider (including AWS Bedrock for LLM access) GitHub Actions for CI   Key Responsibilities   Design, build, and operate backend services and APIs that power AI features (performance, reliability, cost efficiency, and security by design). Integrate LLMs via AWS Bedrock; define robust calling patterns, guardrails, and evaluation loops with ML Engineers. Build asynchronous pipelines and orchestration for multi‑step workflows (e.g., Step Functions, SQS/Kafka, retries, idempotency). Define data models, contracts, and interfaces enabling clear collaboration across squads; contribute to platform components reusable by other teams. Instrument services with metrics, tracing, logs, and evaluations to measure quality (latency, accuracy, cost, user outcomes) and drive iteration. Contribute to technical vision and deliver complex projects end‑to‑end; propose POCs/experiments and iterate quickly based on signal. Improve engineering processes, tools, and systems to enhance productivity and scalability; champion “you build it, you run it”. Mentor and inspire fellow engineers; share best practices in reliability, performance, and secure coding.   How We Work (AI/Data Squad)   AI‑first, product‑led: prototype fast, test with real users, iterate based on data. You build it, you run it: squads own deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvements. Collaboration by default: work hand‑in‑hand with PM, Design, and ML Engineering; align on outcomes, not just outputs. Pragmatic engineering: make clear trade‑offs; optimize for impact over theoretical perfection.   What We’re Looking For   Fluency in written and spoken English (our business language) 2+ years of experience in software development (5+ years for Senior Engineer positions) Strong AI mindset Proven track record of delivering high‑quality, scalable AI products Ability to translate business and product concepts into technical solutions Enthusiasm for working in a fast‑paced environment, with a focus on continuous growth and craft mastery Strong customer‑centric mindset Alignment with Spendesk’s core values of empowering businesses to achieve more   Nice‑to‑haves (not Required)   Experience integrating LLMs (Bedrock/OpenAI/Anthropic), prompt orchestration, guardrails, and evaluation frameworks.
