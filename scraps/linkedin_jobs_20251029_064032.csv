The Opportunity  Nutanix is a global leader in cloud software and Hyperconverged infrastructure solutions, making infrastructure invisible so that IT can focus on the applications and services that power their business. Companies around the world use Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software to bring one-click application management and mobility across public, private and distributed edge clouds so they can run any application at any scale with a dramatically lower total cost of ownership. The result is organizations that can rapidly deliver a high-performance IT environment on demand, giving application owners a true cloud-like experience.  About The Team  At Nutanix, you will be part of the Data Platform team – engineers working across India and the US team and passionate about open source and distributed data infrastructure.  We build and operate internal platforms around ClickHouse (analytical database) and NATS (streaming service) that power analytics and real-time workloads across 10+ Nutanix products.  Product teams depend on us for reliable, scalable, and performant data solutions — and we take pride in being the subject matter experts (SMEs) for ClickHouse and NATS within Nutanix.

The team culture emphasizes unity, deep engineering, a shared focus on achieving goals, fostering collaboration and innovation.

Therefore, there are no travel requirements for this position, allowing you to focus on your work and professional development without the added stress of frequent travel.  Your Role   Design, build, and maintain scalable distributed data systems using ClickHouse and NATS. Write high-quality, efficient, and maintainable code for core data platform components. Participate in ClickHouse and NATS open-source communities — stay current with updates, usage patterns, and contribute wherever required. Debug and optimize distributed systems in production to ensure performance and reliability. Evaluate emerging technologies and open-source tools that can strengthen the platform and drive adoption across teams. Build and operate robust internal platforms that power multiple engineering teams within Nutanix.   What You Will Bring   Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Science or a related field.

Proven ability to work with large, complex codebases and deliver high-quality, maintainable software. Strong grasp of design patterns and the ability to evaluate trade-offs when applying them. Prior open-source contributions, especially to distributed databases or data infrastructure projects, are a strong plus.

In locations where our workplace policy applies (i.e. San Jose, Durham, Mexico City, Bangalore, Pune, Hoofddorp, Belgrade, Barcelona, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo), employees are expected to work onsite a minimum of 3 days per week to foster collaboration, team alignment, and access to in-office resources. Workplace type may vary based on location and team requirements. Please speak with your recruiter for details. Additional team-specific guidance and norms will be provided by your manager.  The pay range for this position at commencement of employment is expected to be between USD $ 143,200 and USD $ 285,600 per year.  However, base pay offered may vary depending on multiple individualized factors, including market location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. The total compensation package for this position may also include other elements, including a sign-on bonus, restricted stock units, and discretionary awards in addition to a full range of medical, financial, and/or other benefits (including 401(k) eligibility and various paid time off benefits, such as vacation, sick time, and parental leave), dependent on the position offered. Details of participation in these benefit plans will be provided if an employee receives an offer of employment.  If hired, employee will be in an “at-will position” and the Company reserves the right to modify base salary (as well as any other discretionary payment or compensation program) at any time, including for reasons related to individual performance, Company or individual department/team performance, and market factors.

Improve reliability, scalability, and performance by developing new system capabilities. Own your code end-to-end from design to production. Solve complex technical challenges with production distributed systems. Develop software in JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, and C++.    What We’re Looking For   5+ years of experience writing systems software. Operational mindset – we don’t just write code, we own it in production. Strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and system design. Deep expertise in at least one systems programming language (e.g., C/C++ or Rust).

This is a high-impact role for engineers who thrive in fast-paced, distributed environments and want to shape the future of cloud computing. If that sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!  What Makes Cloudflare Special?  We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.  Project Galileo: Since 2014, we've equipped more than 2,400 journalism and civil society organizations in 111 countries with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.  Athenian Project: In 2017, we created the Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration. Since the project, we've provided services to more than 425 local government election websites in 33 states.  1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.  Sound like something you’d like to be a part of? We’d love to hear from you!  This position may require access to information protected under U.S. export control laws, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations.

Since 2011, our mission hasn’t changed — we’re here to stop breaches, and we’ve redefined modern security with the world’s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We’re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We’re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.  About The Role:   You'll be joining our MacOS Sensor Foundation team supporting CrowdStrike's flagship Falcon endpoint protection platform. This team is responsible for core sensor components in user space (C++, Swift). We build and maintain the MacOS sensor, creating and/or building a platform for products and features that empower customers with prevention, detection, and response capabilities.  What You’ll Do:  CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.  The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.  This is a Senior macOS Engineer role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on macOS. Engineers in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Windows and Linux.  Responsibilities:   Design and develop software for deployment on macOS systems Own features from design to delivery Collaborate with multi-functional team in various physical locations Troubleshoot issues with the product as reported from customers responsively Other projects as assigned   What You’ll Need   Can develop high-quality code in C/C++ and Swift, and can demonstrate that capability, through job experience, schoolwork, or contributions to community projects Experience on macOS developing product code with the following characteristics: high concurrency requirements needing strong use of multi-threading high reliability requirements detailed requirements on low-level operating characteristics (memory usage, efficient performance, correct conformance to external standards) Experience working on a team to ship major features and releases Able to communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team   Bonus Points:    Prior Experience working on Endpoint product or within Cyber Security space   #HTF  Benefits Of Working At CrowdStrike:   Remote-friendly and flexible work culture Market leader in compensation and equity awards Comprehensive physical and mental wellness programs Competitive vacation and holidays for recharge Paid parental and adoption leaves Professional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role Employee Networks, geographic neighborhood groups, and volunteer opportunities to build connections Vibrant office culture with world class amenities Great Place to Work Certified™ across the globe   CrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
